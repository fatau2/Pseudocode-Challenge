WEEK 2 Pseudocode challenge

1. Newton second law

ALgorithm

1. Store 600kg as value for mass(m)
2. Store 2 m/s2 as value for acceleration(a)
3. Multiply the value of mass with acceleration

Pseudocode

Mass EQUALS 600kg
Acceleration EQUALS 2 m/s2
COMPUTE Force as Mass times Acceleration

2. Tahun Kabisat

Algorithm

1. Store value for number of days in a year
2. Divide the number of year by 4 and 100 and 400
3. The year is leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not 100 or
it is divisible by 4, 100, and 400.

Pseudocode

READ number of days in a year
Value "A" EQUALS number of days in a year divided by 4
Value "B" EQUALS number of days in a year divided by 100
Value "C" EQUALS number of days in a year divided by 400
IF A is zero and B is not 0, the year is a leap year
IF A,B, and C are zero the year is a leap year
ELSE the year is not a leap year

3. Laundry Day

Algorithm

1. Store value for number of clothes in the washing machine
2. Washing machine is on only when there are 20 clothes in it

Pseudocode

READ number of clothes in the washing machine
SET condition of the washing machine as off
WHILE number of clothes in the washing machine is LESS than 20 the machine is off otherwise it is set to on

4. Periksa Kuku

Algorithm

1. Store value of number of students as 40
2. Store value for number of students already checked by the teacher
3. Teacher punish a student if he/she has long nails, otherwise he/she applauds the student
3. Teacher keeps checking for the students' nails until all students are checked

Pseudocode

Students not checked EQUALS 40
FOR every student in "student not checked" teacher checked the student's nail
IF student has long nails the teacher punish them THEN number of students not checked is reduced by 1
ELSE student is applauded THEN number of students not checked is reduced by 1
IF number of students not checked EQUALS 0 the teacher is done checking
